## FAQ

### When I change my settings, it doesn't always work

Currently, the bluetooth connection from your phone to the Fitbit is not 100% stable. Therefore the watch does not always get the settings changed on your phone. Fitbit are aware of the issue and are currently working on a fix. Unfortunately I cannot do anything about this.

### I would like to display my clock is in 24h time

You can change your clock display preferences in your account on the the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit website</a>. Click on the Settings cog and choose Settings from the dropdown list. "Clock Display Time" is listed in the Advanced Settings section. You can choose from "12 hour" or "24 hour" settings. This may take a few minutes to come into effect.
